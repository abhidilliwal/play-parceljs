# Experimenting with Parcel JS
ParcelJS: https://parceljs.org/

## Running this project

First thing first:

`npm install`


For dev mode:

`parcel index.html`

OR

for prod mode:

`parcel build index.html`


## My take on ParcelJS

Good Parts:
+ works without config
+ very intuitive
+ faster
+ hot reload and stuff
+ works seamlessly with other things like scss, babel etc.

Bad Parts:
- Buggy right now, not really production ready. For example the final build still outputs code uncompressed. I think this will go away soon.
- It gives a powerful control but then there is a deep learning curve.
